			The second branch of the two main is <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_geography" target="_blank">Human geography</a> is concerned with the study of people, their communities, cultures, economies,
			and interactions with the environment by studying their relations with and across space and place.
			<br>
			<br>
			The name <strong>Human Geography</strong> suggests, this discipline delves into the study of humans and their intricate relationships with the spaces and places they inhabit. 
			It captures the essence of how human societies, with their varied cultures, histories, and economies, navigate and shape the physical world around them. 
			Through this lens, we discern not just where people live, but more critically, why they live there, how their environments influence their lives, and in turn,
			how their actions impact those very environments. Simply put, <strong>Human Geography</strong> offers a profound exploration of the interplay between humanity and the diverse landscapes of our planet.
			<br>
			<br>
